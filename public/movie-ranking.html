        <h1>Sandro's Top 6 Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 6 favorite movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Top Gun (1986)</h3>
<p>Not because I was born in 1986. Growing up, I actually didn't like Top Gun at all. Later on in life, I've grown to love it.</p>

<h3>Cobra (1986)</h3>
<p>Again, not due to my birth year. Easily one of the best classic Stallone films out there.</p>

<h3>Terminator II (1991)</h3>
<p>Mom and I watched this when I was little, fond memories. And yes, the ending STILL gets my teary-eyed.</p>

<h3>Independence Day (1996)</h3>
<p>Little did I know, at the time, this movie would be the gateway for my love of fighter jets.</p>

<h3>The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly (1966)</h3>
<p>Grandma's favorite. Whatever happened to Western classics?</p>

<h3>Only The Strong (1993)</h3>
<p>The first film I'd seen with Mark Dacascos. In this, he gathers a group of teenagers and mentors them on the art of Capoeira.</p>
